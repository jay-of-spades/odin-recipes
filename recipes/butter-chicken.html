      alt="A deep metallic dish with loop handles on either side, filled with a creamy red-orange stew. Shaves of fresh green onions deck the peaks of this flavorful mound. This Butter Chicken has larger than bite-size pieces of chicken meat piled neatly at the center of the dish. Next to it is a bowl of basmati white rice. The bowls of rice and chicken sit atop a metallic tray with a matte finish, with a slice of lime between the two bowls."

    <h2>Rich, glossy, effortless creaminess that is a sure crowd-pleaser</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 6-ounce can tomato paste</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 2-inch
        pieces
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lime zest</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
      <li>
        1 cup coconut milk (if necessary, whisk to combine the liquid and solids
        before measuring)
      </li>
      <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>¼ cup cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
      <li>Cooked basmati or jasmine rice, for serving</li>
      <li>Naan, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        In medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions to
        skillet, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to
        medium, add garlic and ginger, and cook another 2 minutes. Add garam
        masala, tomato paste and salt; cook and stir 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken pieces in a slow cooker, then add tomato paste mixture,
        lime zest and juice, coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir everything
        together, cover and cook on low heat setting for 4½ to 5 hours, until
        the chicken is cooked through. (You may let it cook up to 7 hours if
        necessary, but the chicken may be very soft and shred.) Garnish with
        cilantro and serve with basmati or jasmine rice, and naan if you have
        some.
