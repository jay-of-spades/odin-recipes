      <li>2 brown onions, sliced</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1.5 litres (1.6 qt) beef stock</li>
      <li>2 tbsp sticky rice (also called glutinous rice)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp crushed roasted peanuts</li>
      <li>4 medium-sized Japanese eggplant</li>
      <li>¼ cup smooth peanut butter</li>
      <li>250g (9 oz) snake or green beans, cut into 5cm (2”) pieces</li>
      <li>¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>

      <li>steamed rice, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season pieces of osso bucco all over with salt and pepper. Place
        vegetable oil into a large saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the
        seasoned osso bucco. Cook for 3 minutes until brown on the one side,
        then flip and cook for another 3 minutes until the other side has
        coloured too. Transfer beef to the pot of a slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and saute annatto seeds for 1-2 minutes until the
        excess oil becomes red. Now remove and discard the annatto seeds,
        leaving the remaining oil behind. Add in the onion and garlic, plus a
        good pinch of salt, and saute for a further 2 minutes until tender and
        translucent. Add 1 cup of beef stock to deglaze the pan and, using a
        wooden spatula, gently scrape off any bits from the bottom of the pan
        &mdash; they&#39;re full of flavour! Transfer liquid and softened onions
        to the slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a small frying pan over high heat and add the sticky rice. Keeping
        a close eye on it so it doesn&#39;t burn, gently toast the rice until
        it&#39;s a deep golden colour. Transfer to a mortar and use a pestle to
        grind to a fine powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the slow cooker on high heat. Add the ground rice to the slow
        cooker followed by the peanuts, eggplant, peanut butter and the
        remaining beef stock. Give everything a gentle mix to incorporate the
        peanut butter into the liquid. Then cover the stew with a lid and leave
        to do its thing for 3 hours, or until the meat is falling off the bone.
        (If your slow cooker doesn&#39;t have a high setting, you can put it on
        low for 6 hours.)
      </li>
      <li>
        After the first cook is complete, open the lid of the slow cooker and
        add in the beans. Season the stew with the vinegar, fish sauce and brown
        sugar. Give everything a good mix around to make sure all of the
        ingredients are well incorporated, then place the lid back on and cook
        for a further 20 minutes until the beans are tender. Serve with steamed
        rice.
